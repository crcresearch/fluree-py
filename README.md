## ✨ Features

- 🔒 Type-safe API interactions using Pydantic models
- ⚡ Modern async/await HTTP client using `httpx`
- 🔄 Support for both synchronous and asynchronous operations
- 📝 Full type hints support
- ✅ Extensive test coverage with pytest and hypothesis
- 📚 Detailed documentation with MkDocs
- 🚀 Fast and efficient with `uv` package management
- 🧹 Clean code with `ruff` linting and formatting

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install fluree-py
```

### Basic Usage

The library supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations. Here's an example showing both approaches:

```python
from fluree_py import FlureeClient

# Initialize the client
client = FlureeClient(url="http://localhost:8090")

# Create a ledger with initial data
to_commit = (
    client.with_ledger("example/ledger")
    .create()
    .with_context(
        {
            "ex": "http://example.org/",
            "schema": "http://schema.org/",
        }
    )
    .with_insert(
        {
            "@id": "ex:freddy",
            "@type": "ex:Yeti",
            "schema:age": 4,
            "schema:name": "Freddy",
        }
    )
)

# Synchronous commit operation
response = to_commit.commit()
print("Sync response:", response.json())

# Asynchronous commit operation
response = await to_commit.acommit()
print("Async response:", response.json())
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

The library is built with a modular architecture:

- `fluree_py/http/` - HTTP client implementation using `httpx`
- `fluree_py/types/` - Type definitions and Pydantic models

## 🛠️ Development

This project uses modern Python development tools and practices:

- 🚀 `uv` for build and package management
- 🔍 `pytest` for testing
- 🧹 `ruff` for linting
- 📚 `mkdocs` for documentation
- 🔄 `hypothesis` for property-based testing

### Setup Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/crcresearch/fluree-py.git
cd fluree-py
```

2. Install development dependencies:
```bash
uv sync --all-extras --dev
```

### Running Tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

### Building Documentation

```bash
uv run mkdocs build
```

### Code Style

This project follows the following code style guidelines:

- Use `ruff` for linting and formatting
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Use docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and small
